    <p><strong>What is Covexit?</strong></p>
    <p>Covexit is an online marketplace that enables local retailers to easily offer their products online and thereby help to overcome the corona crisis.</p>
    <p>A team of experts will support you with the preparations for your account, so that it is as easy as possible for you to bring your business online</p>
    <p><strong>Who are Covexit?</strong></p>
    <p>Covexit started as an initiative by students from the KIT in Karlsruhe. Seeing shops in their area having to close due to Covid-19 motivated them to start the online marketplace
     and help particularly those local shops stay connected with their customers and continue their business.</p>
    <p>During the German #WirVsVirus Hackathon, then #TheGlobalHack and later #EUvsVirus, the team grew and is now made up of developers, marketing and communications experts, business strategists and many more.</p>
    <p>We, the Covexit Team, are happy that you found your way to this platform and are interested in the project. Feel free to reach out to us! </p>
